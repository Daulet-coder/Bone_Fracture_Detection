# Bone_Fracture_Detection
A trained model that can detect bone fractures based on X-ray images.

A powerful AI tool for bone fracture detection on X-ray images

Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing bone fractures, but manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this, it is developed an automated detection tool using YOLO model.

Key Highlights
Model: Trained on the YOLO architecture (You Only Look Once), which is widely known for its high-speed and precise object detection capabilities.

Performance: Achieves relatively good results, accurately identifying fracture areas on X-ray images and highlighting them with bounding boxes.

Deployment: The tool can be integrated into local hospital systems or used as a standalone application to analyze uploaded X-ray images.

User-friendly Interface: Simple drag-and-drop functionality for image uploads, with instant visual feedback.

Purpose: Reduce workload for medical professionals, improve patient care by minimizing misdiagnosis, and speed up the decision-making process.

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE â€” BONE_FRACTURE_DETECTION
Frontend (UI): Intuitive interface for uploading and visualizing X-ray results.

Backend: YOLO-based detection model trained on labeled medical image datasets to localize fractures.

Local Deployment: Can run on local servers or desktops to ensure data privacy and comply with medical data regulations.

Future Vision: Potential integration with hospital systems to automatically analyze X-ray images upon acquisition and highlight fracture areas in real time, providing immediate support to medical staff.
